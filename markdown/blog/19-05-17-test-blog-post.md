# Here's how IPFS works
### Let's take a look at what happens when you add files to IPFS:

![How it works 1](https://ipfs.io/images/ipfs-illustrations-how-1.svg) 
> Each file and all of the blocks within it are given a unique fingerprint called a cryptographic hash.

![How it works 2](https://ipfs.io/images/ipfs-illustrations-how-2.svg) 
> IPFS removes duplications across the network.

![How it works 3](https://ipfs.io/images/ipfs-illustrations-how-3.svg) 
> Each network node stores only content it is interested in, and some indexing information that helps figure out who is storing what.

![How it works 4](https://ipfs.io/images/ipfs-illustrations-how-4.svg) 
> When looking up files, you're asking the network to find nodes storing the content behind a unique hash.

> Every file can be found by human-readable names using a decentralized naming system called IPNS.
